          As a means of eliminating waste and excess water that the body does
          not require, urine serves a crucial purpose in the body. Urine passes
          via the urinary system, a pathway that contains kidneys that filter
          waste from the blood, before leaving your body. It can be used to
          diagnose a variety of illnesses. In fact, the hue of your urine may
          reveal important information about your internal health. Dehydration
          is typically indicated by dark yellow urine, while reddish urine may
          be cancerous. There are many other causes of pink, brown, purple, or
          milky urine, including the foods you eat, the medications you take,
          and certain medical disorders.Many disorders can be diagnosed through
